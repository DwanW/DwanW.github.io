**What am I up to??**

Currently, I'm working on an application to improve the efficiency of laboratory data analysis. I have recently also developed application with modern frameworks such as Next.js and Tailwindcss. I love working with Gatsby with how fast the development speed is and the ease of management with graphQL data layer, but I find myself also enjoy developing using Next.js and just how easy it is to use and the flexibility of it. In the meantime, I'm looking forward to the server component React team announced last year, and I am open to opportunities that tackle challenging problems. If you have a project that need a hand, feel free to send me a message. I am more than happy to help during my free time.
