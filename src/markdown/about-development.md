**What am I up to after work**

Outside of work, I enjoy delving into the world of artificial intelligence through research. Currently, I'm exploring voice synthesis and cloning, keen on testing their capabilities and practical applications in conjunction with GPT. I see potential in these technologies shaping the future of education and learning, and I'm curious to see how they unfold.
