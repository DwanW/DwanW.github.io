**What am I up to??**

Native apps are something I'm always curious about. Currently, with help of some awesome resources I am diving into the world of native app development using react native and other languages. My previous role put a lot of emphasis on frontend development which I learned a lot about. At the same time I am planning to contribute to some project to keep my backend skills sharp as well. If you have a project that involves backend development and need a hand, I am more than happy to help during my free time.
