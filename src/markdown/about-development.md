**What am I up to??**

Currently, I'm working on an offline-usable, cross-platform, fast and flexible progress tracking application and a widely used city service commercial application, I enjoy the new feature Redux state management toolkit offers as well as using typescript in development process. In the meantime, I'm looking forward to the server component React team announced last year, and I am open to opportunities that tackle challenging problems. If you have a project that need a hand, feel free to send me a message. I am more than happy to help during my free time.
