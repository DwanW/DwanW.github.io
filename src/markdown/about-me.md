Hi there!

I'm a full-stack developer who is passionate in application design and development, I love tackling challenging problems and have strong proficiency in modern web technologies.

Being a developer is addictive at times. “I often find myself trying to come up with solutions to a problem in dreams, and have so much fun on my projects where, as soon as I wake up, I would jump out of bed and go straight to the computer to work on it”. That is me in simple terms.

I stay up to date with the latest technologies that help improve business solutions and always learning to improve my skills through coursework and professional development. I believe that perseverance with purpose is the key to growth, overcoming great challenges, and achieving success. So I’m always looking for opportunities to take on exciting challenges, head over to the [contact section](#contact) below and send me a message. I would love to hear from you!
